# HumHub-RSS-Reader

A [HumHub][HUMHUB] module which imports an [RSS News Feed][RSS] as [Posts][POSTS] in the Stream of a [Space][SPACES].

The current plan only supports one [RSS News Feed][RSS] to be placed in each [Space][SPACES].

Once this module has posted the News Item into the Stream, it can be followed, liked and commented on in the usual way. Any feedback of this kind remains local to your [HumHub][HUMHUB] web site - is *not* fed back to the [RSS News Feed][RSS].
